Each of R-files repeats the code to extract the necessary data set from the originary big data file (Lines 1 to 63 in the R-Studio editor).

The extracted data is saved in the file **out.txt** which is used for the further processing and plotting so you could start just there, if you wish: in this case skip the code until the line ` # Now reading the filtered data.` after running it once in the **Plot1.R**.

The code lines which download the zipped source file from the web and delete the big source files in the working directory later are shown but commented out for the sake of security.
